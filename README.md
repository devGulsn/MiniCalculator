# Mini Calculator

A command-line calculator built in C++ with support for:

- Basic arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
- Power operator: ^
- Parentheses and operator precedence
- Modular structure with custom parser and clean design

🛠️ Built using multiple `.cpp` and `.h` files for clean code separation.

✅ Created as part of my application to the Google Software Engineering Apprenticeship 2025.
